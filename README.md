## Hardware Design Notes

### AL8860 Integration
- **Hysteretic Control** - Better efficiency for LED drivers
- **Lower Switching Frequency** - Reduces EMI and heat
- **Built-in Soft-start** - Reduces inrush current
- **Optimized Effects** - Designed for hysteretic behavior

### LM3414 Integration  
- **High Switching Frequency** - Enables smaller inductors
- **Better Regulation** - Higher accuracy for precise color control
- **Higher PWM Resolution** - Smoother effects and better color mixing
- **Fast Response** - Suitable for high-frequency effects

### 100W COB LED Design Considerations
- **High Power Density** - 100W total (25W per channel) in compact package
- **Multiple LED Drivers** - Requires 4 separate driver circuits (one per channel)
- **Thermal Management** - Critical for performance and longevity
- **Current Control** - Precise regulation for color accuracy and thermal protection
- **Color Mixing** - Physical LED die placement affects color uniformity
- **Power Distribution** - High current paths for each channel
- **Isolation** - Electrical isolation between channels may be required

### Thermal Management (Critical for 100W Operation)
- **Heatsink Requirements** - Minimum 0.5Â°C/W thermal resistance
- **Thermal Interface** - High-quality thermal compound or thermal pads required
- **Temperature Monitoring** - Thermal protection circuits strongly recommended
- **Active Cooling** - Fans or liquid cooling required for continuous operation
- **Thermal Derating** - Automatic current reduction at high temperatures
- **Heat Distribution** - Ensure even heat spreading across COB surface
- **Ambient Considerations** - Derate power in high ambient temperature environments

### Power Supply Requirements
- **Voltage**: 36V or 48V recommended for efficiency
- **Current**: Minimum 3A (for 100W operation)
- **Regulation**: Â±1% voltage regulation recommended
- **Ripple**: <100mV peak-to-peak for LED driver stability
- **Protection**: Overcurrent and overvoltage protection required

## Troubleshooting

### Firmware Issues

**Device Not Advertising:**
- Check BLE is enabled in sdkconfig
- Verify GPIO pins don't conflict with internal peripherals
- Check serial output for error messages

**LEDs Not Working:**
- Verify GPIO configuration matches your hardware
- Check PWM frequency is appropriate for your LED drivers
- Ensure adequate power supply for 100W COB LED (36V/3A minimum)
- Check thermal protection - LED may shut down if overheating
- Verify heatsink is properly installed with thermal interface
- Check individual channel drivers - one channel failure affects only that color
- Monitor LED temperature - COB LEDs are sensitive to overheating

**Configuration Issues:**
- Run `idf.py fullclean` if changing board types
- Verify all Kconfig options are set correctly
- Check for GPIO conflicts in menuconfig

### Web App Issues

**Cannot Connect to Device:**
- Ensure browser supports Web Bluetooth
- Check if device is advertising (check firmware logs)
- Try refreshing the page and scanning again
- Verify HTTPS is used (required for Web Bluetooth)

**QR Scanner Not Working:**
- Ensure adequate lighting for QR code
- Try different camera angles
- Check if QR code is properly generated

**Poor Performance:**
- Check Bluetooth signal strength
- Close other BLE connections
- Refresh the page to reset connection
- Try from a different device

### QR Code Issues

**QR Code Won't Scan:**
- Ensure sufficient contrast (dark on light background)
- Check label print quality
- Verify QR code size is adequate for scanning distance
- Test with different QR scanner apps

**Generated Labels Look Poor:**
- Use vector formats (PDF, SVG) for printing
- Ensure printer resolution is adequate
- Check template compatibility with label stock
